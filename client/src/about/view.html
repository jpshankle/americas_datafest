      Immi<span class="viz">Viz</span> is an interactive tool designed to help advocates, journalists and communities better understand the costs and results of migration.  Remittances (money sent home by migrants) have a huge impact on the economies of recipient countries.  The personal impact of remittances, and some of the challenges faced by migrants on their journeys to be in a position where they can send money home, are illustrated in the Stories section of the website.

      Remittances could go even further toward ending extreme poverty if the sending and receiving costs were lowered.  Extreme poverty is <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview">defined by the World Bank</a> as living on $1.25 or less per day.  Cutting the costs associated with remittances could have a great impact in this area, as the Numbers section of the website shows.

      Many factors go into determining the transaction fees associated with remittances, but hopefully by visualizing some of the costs and impacts of remittances this site can help move the discussion on this topic forward.</p>
